# TEXTREME
Textreme is an opensource meaty text editor.
There are a number of directions we can take it from here so that's why I created this repo.
From here we can make it a viable outer layer for text-based games, or make it a viable code editor, its all up to you!
If you believe a certain feature would benefit the editor, make it and share with everyone else!
